## 📁 Project Overview
This Python project performs a detailed analysis of website traffic data to understand user behavior, engagement, and session trends over time. It addresses seven key questions about traffic sources, user engagement, peak hours, and correlations between sessions and engagement.

Using Pandas and Matplotlib, the project aggregates and visualizes data to provide actionable insights for improving website performance, optimizing marketing channels, and enhancing user engagement.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook
-  Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- seaborn 

## 📂 Dataset Info
The dataset used in this project contains detailed website traffic logs, capturing user interactions on an hourly basis. It includes the following key columns:

- DateHour: Timestamp combining date and hour, representing the time of website activity.

- sessions: Number of sessions recorded in that hour. A session represents a single visit by a user.

- users: Count of unique users who visited the website during that hour.

- channel: Marketing or traffic channel through which users arrived (e.g., Organic Search, Paid Search, Direct, Referral, Social).

- engagement_time: Average time users spent engaged during the session (in seconds or minutes).

- engagement_rate: Percentage of engaged sessions out of total sessions, indicating user interest level.

- session_type: Classification of sessions into engaged and non-engaged categories.

This structured data enables detailed analysis of traffic trends, user behavior, and channel effectiveness across different times of day and days of the week.

## 6) At what hours of the day does each channel drive the most traffic?
### 🕒 Traffic by Hour and Channel – Key Insights
Peak traffic occurs between 11 AM to 6 PM across most channels.

Organic Social shows consistently high traffic, especially around 1 PM to 4 PM.

Email campaigns perform best around 12 PM, with a major spike.

Organic Search drives traffic mostly between 11 AM to 3 PM.

## 7) Is there any correlation between high traffic (sessions) and high engagement rate over time?
### 📈 Correlation Between Sessions & Engagement Rate – Key Insights
Sessions (orange line) show frequent spikes, indicating high traffic variation across dates.

Engagement rate (red line) remains mostly flat and low throughout the observed period.

There is no strong correlation between high traffic and high engagement — even when session counts rise, engagement doesn't significantly increase.

Conclusion: High traffic does not guarantee high engagement. Focus on content quality and user experience to boost engagement rate
