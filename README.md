## 📁 Project Overview
This Python project performs a detailed analysis of website traffic data to understand user behavior, engagement, and session trends over time. It addresses seven key questions about traffic sources, user engagement, peak hours, and correlations between sessions and engagement.

Using Pandas and Matplotlib, the project aggregates and visualizes data to provide actionable insights for improving website performance, optimizing marketing channels, and enhancing user engagement.

## 📂 Dataset Info
The dataset used in this project contains detailed website traffic logs, capturing user interactions on an hourly basis. It includes the following key columns:

- DateHour: Timestamp combining date and hour, representing the time of website activity.

- sessions: Number of sessions recorded in that hour. A session represents a single visit by a user.

- users: Count of unique users who visited the website during that hour.

- channel: Marketing or traffic channel through which users arrived (e.g., Organic Search, Paid Search, Direct, Referral, Social).

- engagement_time: Average time users spent engaged during the session (in seconds or minutes).

- engagement_rate: Percentage of engaged sessions out of total sessions, indicating user interest level.

- session_type: Classification of sessions into engaged and non-engaged categories.

This structured data enables detailed analysis of traffic trends, user behavior, and channel effectiveness across different times of day and days of the week.
